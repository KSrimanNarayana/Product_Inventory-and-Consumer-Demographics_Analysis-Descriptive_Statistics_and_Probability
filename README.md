# Product Inventory & Consumer Demographics Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes product inventory data and provides insights on customer demographics, specifically focusing on **gender distribution** for specific products. 

### Key Insight:
One of the key insights derived from the analysis is the **conditional probability of gender given a product inventory**. For example, given a KP481 treadmill, we can estimate the number of male and female buyers based on the product inventory data.

### Conditional Probability Example:
For the KP481 treadmill:
- If we have 1000 KP481 treadmills in stock:
  - **483 females** are likely to purchase the product based on the probability (48.33%)
  - **517 males** are likely to purchase the product based on the probability (51.67%)

This insight can help in understanding target demographics for marketing strategies and optimizing stock levels based on gender preferences.

### To identify the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better recommendation of the treadmills to the new customers.

### Key Features:

   - Performed descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each AeroFit treadmill product by developing appropriate tables and charts.
   - For each AeroFit treadmill product, constructed two-way contingency tables and compute all conditional and marginal probabilities along with their insights/impact on the business.
